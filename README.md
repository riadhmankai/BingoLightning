# Bingo Lightning App

## Description

This is a fun game to play during your scrum daily meetings. Whenever a participant says something that figures on the Bingo board, we click on that cell to mark it as selected. If a whole row, a whole column or a whole diagonal is selected, the game is won and you can click the button "play again".

## Development

The game was developed using the new Salesforce DX (Developer Experience). I used the new force.com CLI along with Microsoft Visual Studio Code with the new Salesforce plugin. The goal was for me to learn how to use Salesforce DX, and use new features like Scratch orgs, CLI etc. I essentially used scratch orgs for testing purposes, and then deployed to a classic sandbox to see the final result.


## How to Get This Game

Since this is a Salesforce DX project, you can simply clone the repo and use it directly within your environment. You can then push it to scratch org, or deploy it to your owrn sandbox using your preferred deployment tool. 
Alternatively, you can deploy the "mdapioutput" zip file using your preferred deployment tool or the force.com CLI.
