# Bingo Lightning App

## Description

This is a fun game that you can play during you scrum daily meetings. Whenever a participant says something that figures on the Bingo board, we click on that cell to mark it as selected.

## Development

The app was developed using the new Salesforce DX (Developer Experience). I used the new force.com CLI along with Visual Studio code with the new Salesforce plugin. The goal was for me to learn how to use Salesforce DX, and use new features like Scratch orgs, CLI etc.


## How to Get This Game

Since this is a Salesforce DX project, you can simply clone the repo and use it directly within your environment. You can then push to scratch org, or deploy to your owrn sandbox using your preferred tool.
